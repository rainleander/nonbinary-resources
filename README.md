# nonbinary-resources
A curated awesome list of nonbinary resources. Feel free to contribute!

## books
* Life Isn't Binary by Meg-John Barker(@megjohnbarker) and Alex Iantaffi (@XTaffi)
"Much of society's thinking operates in a highly rigid and binary manner; something is good or bad, right or wrong, a success or a failure, and so on. Challenging this limited way of thinking, this groundbreaking publication looks at how non-binary methods of thought can be applied to all aspects of life, offering new and greater ways of understanding ourselves and how we relate to others."
* Epistemology of the Closet by Sedgwick, E.K.
"Sedgwick argues that standard binary oppositions limit freedom and understanding, especially in the context of sexuality. Sedgwick argues that limiting sexuality to homosexuality or heterosexuality, in a structured binary opposition, is just too simplistic."

## contributing to this list
* "Curated": the contribution / link / book / quote / collaboration has been personal reviewed by the maintainer or contributor
* "Awesome": helpful / inspirational / informative / educational
* "NonBinary": not relating to, composed of, or involving just two things; [Non-binary or genderqueer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine - identities that are outside the gender binary. Non-binary identities can fall under the transgender umbrella, since many non-binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.
* "Resources": a [source or supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource) from which a benefit is produced and that has some utility
