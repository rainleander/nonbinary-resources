* Life Isn't Binary by Meg-John Barker(@megjohnbarker) and Alex Iantaffi (@XTaffi)
"Much of society's thinking operates in a highly rigid and binary manner; something is good or bad, right or wrong, a success or a failure, and so on. Challenging this limited way of thinking, this groundbreaking publication looks at how non-binary methods of thought can be applied to all aspects of life, offering new and greater ways of understanding ourselves and how we relate to others."
