* Life Isn't Binary by Meg-John Barker(@megjohnbarker) and Alex Iantaffi (@XTaffi)
"Much of society's thinking operates in a highly rigid and binary manner; something is good or bad, right or wrong, a success or a failure, and so on. Challenging this limited way of thinking, this groundbreaking publication looks at how non-binary methods of thought can be applied to all aspects of life, offering new and greater ways of understanding ourselves and how we relate to others."
* Sedgwick, E.K. (1990) *[Epistemology of the Closet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology_of_the_Closet)*. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pretice Hall

## contributing to this list
"Curated": the contribution / link / book / quote / collaboration has been personal reviewed by the maintainer or contributor
"Awesome": helpful / inspirational / informative / educational
"NonBinary": not relating to, composed of, or involving just two things; [Non-binary or genderqueer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine - identities that are outside the gender binary. Non-binary identities can fall under the transgender umbrella, since many non-binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.
"Resources": a [source or supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource) from which a benefit is produced and that has some utility
